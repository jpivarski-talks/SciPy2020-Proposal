## Title

**Awkward Array: Manipulating JSON-like Data with NumPy-like Idioms**

_(In the 2019 program, talks about a software library had this form: library name, colon, short description, most words capitalized.)_

## The Short Summary

_(The brief description which will appear in the online program and give attendees a basic sense of your talk. This should be around 100 words or less.)_

NumPy simplifies and accelerates mathematical calculations in Python, but only for rectilinear arrays of numbers. Awkward Array provides a similar interface for JSON-like data: slicing, broadcasting, and performing vectorized math on the attributes of objects, unequal length nested lists, and heterogeneous data types. Awkward Arrays are columnar data structures, like (and convertible to/from) Apache Arrow, with a focus on manipulation, rather than serialization/transport. These arrays can be passed between C++ and Python, and they can be used in functions that are JIT-compiled by Numba.

## The Abstract

_(Your placement in the program will be based on reviews of your abstract. This should be a roughly 500 word outline of your presentation. This outline should concisely describe software of interest to the SciPy community, tools or techniques for more effective computing, or how scientific Python was applied to solve a research problem. A traditional background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion structure is encouraged but not required. Links to project websites, source code repositories, figures, full papers, and evidence of public speaking ability are encouraged.)_
