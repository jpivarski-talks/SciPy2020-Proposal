## Title

**Awkward Array: Manipulating JSON-like Data with NumPy-like Idioms**

_(In the 2019 program, talks about a software library had this form: library name, colon, short description, most words capitalized.)_

## Abstract

NumPy simplifies and accelerates mathematical calculations in Python, but only for rectilinear arrays of numbers. Awkward Array provides a similar interface for JSON-like data: slicing, broadcasting, and performing vectorized math on the attributes of objects, unequal length nested lists, and heterogeneous data types. Awkward Arrays are columnar data structures, like (and convertible from/to) Apache Arrow, with a focus on manipulation. Arrays can be passed between C++ and Python, and they can be used in functions that are JIT-compiled by Numba. In the area of overlap, Awkward operations are strict generalizations of NumPy's
